# EIVModels
This repository contains code to run errors-in-variables simple regression and Gaussian process models (using JAGS) to be used in the IGCP 725 Radiocarbon workshop. 

You will need to install the JAGS software in order for the code to run. You will can download from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/).

Download the repo and open the EIV.proj file in Rstudio. Then open the main_script.R to run the code.
